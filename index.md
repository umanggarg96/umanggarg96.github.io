# Projects
1. [**1D Cellular Automaton on FPGA:**](http://github.com/umanggarg96/cellular_automaton_1d) Hardware cellular automaton emulator with 256 rules to determine next state, output to VGA screen. Written in SystemVerilog.
2. [**RISC Processor on FPGA:**](http://github.com/umanggarg96/hack_cpu) General purpose embedded processor developed and verified in simulation and on FPGA. The processor has memory mapped peripheral to interface with input and output (VGA monitor) devices. An assembler for the machine language of the processor is implemented using C language.
3. **Music Synthesis on FPGA, using Hand Gestures:** Intuitive Digital Music Synthesizer that produces tones with varying amplitude and frequency, according to position of players Hands. Written in Verilog.
4. **PONG! Game on FPGA:** A 2-player PONG game, handling of input to the system, generation of Video signal (VGA), and audio generation is done by FPGA. Written in Verilog.
